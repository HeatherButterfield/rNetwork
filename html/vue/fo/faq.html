                            <summary>Not getting your email confirmations?</summary>
							<p>In most cases, the email has gone to your spam and trash folder.  Look for the email subject: rNetwork—Link to Registration. In some rare cases, especially if you created a brand new email for your rNetwork business, our third-party email server can take 24 to 72 hours to deliver your email. This is because of the large number of new customers coming into rNetwork and email validation issues. Please be patient.</p>

							<p><span class="underscore">Do NOT try to sign up again from the start of the registration process,</span> the system will not allow duplicate social security numbers or emails. Simply go to the email you received from rNetwork when you registered for the first time and verified your email address by clicking on the link. Click on that same link to complete your registration. It will take you to the correct page where you can continue your registration and payment. If you can’t find the email link, you can request one be sent to you by our customer service department. *see contact form below.</p>

                            <summary>Please note: We do not allow changes in placement in the organization?</summary>
							<p>The compensation plan is unique in that people above you are helping build your organization. This means that “spillover” will happen and people may be placed below you in your TBS, sometimes in what you may consider as “important” spots. The TBS placement is NOT as important in this compensation structure as what you are probably used to. Once a person is placed in the structure, as a policy, we will not move them.</p>
							<p><em>Customer service can NOT assist you with placement concerns, please talk to your upline for questions you may have regarding organizational placement.</em></p>
