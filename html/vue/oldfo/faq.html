          <button class="faq-question">Not getting your email confirmations?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>In most cases, the email has gone to your spam and trash folder.  Look for the email subject:  <span class="company-name rnetwork"></span>—Link to Registration. In some rare cases, especially if you created a brand new email for your <span class="company-name rnetwork"></span> business, our third-party email server can take 24 to 72 hours to deliver your email. This is because of the large number of new customers coming into rNetwork and email validation issues. Please be patient.</p>

          <!--question block-->
          <button class="faq-question">Please note: We do not allow changes in placement in the organization?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The compensation plan is unique in that people above you are helping build your organization. This means that “spillover” will happen and people may be placed below you in your TBS, sometimes in what you may consider as “important” spots. The TBS placement is NOT as important in this compensation structure as what you are probably used to. Once a person is placed in the structure, as a policy, we will not move them.</p>

              <p><em>Customer service can NOT assist you with placement concerns, please talk to your upline for questions you may have regarding organizational placement.</em></p>
